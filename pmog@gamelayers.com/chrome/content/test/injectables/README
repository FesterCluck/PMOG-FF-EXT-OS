The injectables in this folder are designed for triggering the display of an overlay without having to 
add a button to the HUD or make it show by default.

They require the Extension Developer Extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7434

Once firefox is launched:

	1. open up the Javascript Injector that comes with the above extension
	2. Browse for the desired injectable file from this directory
	3. Ensure that the browser.xul context is chosen
	4. Execute! The overlay should be showing.
